# Some Image processing Methods Implementation on python3

This project includes 2 files and a folder(images) 
------
1. Images which has some sample images for testing
2. RoughImplementation.pynb which is a notebook(jupyter notebook) which as the name suggests was the file where i first coded
my methods and tested before using it in final project which is final.py. This file has some documentation on it which can be helpuful.
3. final.py which is a simple conslole application that allows u to perform all the processing (techniques) that i have implemented so far.

## Steps to Install
1. Clone this project


    `git clone https://github.com/PrijalBista/imageprocessing.git`
    
2. Install all python dependencies with 


    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
3. Then just run final.py with
    
    `python final.py `
      
 
 
  >Note: When u run final.py it loads (images/cat.jpg) by default which u can change by choosing option select image
  >All processing methods have option to either process original image or previously processed image(result of image processed just before)
   
   >Each processing methods have a particular function so you can go through roughimplementation.pynb and look for methods that u might need in your work or project
